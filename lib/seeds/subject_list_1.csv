description,"Global Health Technologies course provides a multi-disciplinary approach to global health technology design using real world projects and partners. The course explores the current state of global health challenges (with special focus on Singapore and her neighbours), and teaches students how to design medical technologies (e.g. products, systems) that address these problems. The same technology that is applicable in developing countries will be tested in Singapore as a pilot run, before being introduced to the neighboring countries. In their respective project groups, students will brainstorm and define current elderly issues pertaining to community hospitals (e.g. St Andrew’s Community Hospital) in Singapore. Guest lectures, panel discussions and organized field trip will allow student to have a first-hand experience to global health issues and help students come up with better solutions. The Biodesign Innovation process will be taught and applied in the student projects.","Driven by a number of real-world questions about our networked lives, this course explores the technology behind the multi-trillion dollar Internet and wireless industries. How does Google sell ad space and rank webpages? How does Netflix recommend movies and Amazon rank products? How can you influence people on Facebook and Twitter and can you really reach anyone in six steps? How can you make your video viral on YouTube? Why doesn’t the Internet collapse under congestion and does it have an Achilles’ heel? Why are you charged per gigabyte for mobile data? How does CDMA work in my smartphone? These are some of the networked life issues the course will address in providing answers to the above questions, which are the subject of a fascinating intersection of disciplines, including computer science, physics, sociology, mathematics and economics. Researchers from these areas all strive to quantify and explain the growing complexity and connectivity of the world around us, and they have begun to develop a rich new science along the way to reason about the new social, economic and technological networks. The course will motivate the student through actual applications to enable both an overview of these systems and a fundamental understanding of the key ideas. It will introduce the various tools and modelling concepts that apply in each situation, targeting at a truly interdisciplinary learning experience.","Introduction and overview of engineering management. Financial principles, management of innovation, technology strategy, and best management practices. Cases are discussed in class for class participation. Focus is on the development of individual skills and team work, and exposure to management tools.","This course provides students with an understanding of current challenges and opportunities in land transportation. It introduces road vehicle propulsion technologies and transportation systems modelling, including the tools and methods to assess technologies and system performance. Topics include conventional and alternative vehicle powertrains, intelligent transportation systems (ITS), transportation network modelling, traffic simulation, and travel demand modelling. Students will complete a project on a subject of their choosing.","This course introduces innovative product design methods and techniques in the crosscultural contexts. In this course, we focus on consumer products (used or consumed by ordinary end users rather than professionals), including physical products and computer software. The first part of the course will introduce empathetic design approach, targeting at designing for niche market. Using this artistic approach, designers is mainly driven by their intrinsic motivations. Some techniques of design semiotics will be taught and students are expected to do some souvenir design on the basis of Singaporean cultural elements. The second part targets at cross-cultural design for the mass market. In collaboration with Alibaba international UED team, we will explore an emerging virtual place for intercultural communication and interactions, mobile commerce applications (m-Commerce apps). In this case, designs are mainly driven by extrinsic requirements. How to understand and response to users from different cultural backgrounds will be a huge challenge for designers. Students will be guided to detach from their own cultural viewpoints, and be sensitive to intercultural differences. Equipped with basic marketing and user study techniques, students are required to do a cross-cultural analysis for products or mobile apps. The insights gained from the cross-cultural user studies will then guide students to finish their course project: designing a cross-cultural m-Commerce app.","Machine learning is the study of algorithms that improve their performance at some task with experience. In this course, students will learn how machine learning has led to many innovative real-world applications. The students will also gain an in-depth understanding of a broad range of machine learning algorithms from basic to state-of-the-art, such as: naïve Bayes, logistic regression, neural networks, clustering, probabilistic graphical models, reinforcement learning and SVMs.","This course will deal with the specific ethical issues arising from a position of leadership. “With great power comes great responsibility”, said a famous superhero. What exactly does this moral responsibility entail? Does the leader have specific obligations? Does his position confer more, or other, rights? What do we mean by a “good” leader? Is it only a matter of efficiency, or does the “good” also involve a specific ethical capability? Does good leadership mean the same thing in different contexts – war, business, politics? Is a good leader the same as a just leader? What mechanisms of accountability does or should leadership entail? The course will envisage proceed by envisaging different types of leadership, on the basis of texts and case-studies. We will discuss general ethical theories, and dimensions of human activity more concerned with ethics of leadership: politics, war, business, science, art, family, religion, etc. We will look at connected themes, such as authority, power, governance, to delineate the concept of leadership more precisely, and look at the ethical scope of this particular dimension of human life.","If Shakespeare could travel through time to the twenty-first century, he would be bewildered to discover that his works were being read and studied as academic texts in university classrooms. In this course, we will read several of Shakespeare’s works—including The Merchant of Venice, Othello, Romeo and Juliet, King Lear, and The Tempest—without staying tethered to words on a printed page. In Shakespeare’s London, playwriting was neither scholarly nor static. His was a dynamic, collaborative, open-access world in which writers borrowed freely from old material and re-shaped it into new forms of entertainment—a concept of creativity that connects Shakespeare to many of his interpreters and fans today. The public theater was one of the most successful forums for popular culture in Renaissance England, and Shakespeare wrote his plays for large and diverse audiences. During Shakespeare’s time, it would not have been unusual for the queen or king of England to be in attendance, watching the performance alongside the groundlings—the often rowdy theatergoers from London’s working classes. In this seminar, we will respond to cinematic productions that restore Shakespeare’s characters and themes to popular culture—both in his own time and around the world. In this course, we’ll read and analyze Shakespeare’s original playtexts alongside global cinematic productions of his plays, including a Bollywood-inspired retelling of Othello and a feudal Japanese reimagining of King Lear. In doing so, we’ll see how these films respond to living issues of politics, gender, race, and nationhood.","A film is, in essence, a design project that relies on a number of creative and technical practices, logistical and financial operations and complex I.T. systems.  This course analyzes the key components of the workflow required to produce film, including many of the latest developments in camera and postproduction technology. The course builds on the skills acquired in HASS 02.103 (Film Studies: History, Theory and Practice), where students complement their studies of film history and theory with a basic filmmaking task. This course provides students with a detailed overview of the processes involved in making professional cinema, the chance to experience each of the main roles (directing, scripting, camera, sound and editing) and to gain advanced skills in one or more of these domains. This will be achieved through a series of individual and group assignments, culminating in the production of a short film. While the focus of this elective is technical, the course simultaneously develops students’ critical appreciation of cinema as an art form – as they learn the intricate mechanics of filmmaking, they will gain a more sophisticated understanding of film language, that is to say, the visual and audio elements that determine meaning in film.",to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled,to be filled
